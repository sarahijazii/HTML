My first endeavor into CSS and HTML involved creating this website on The Seven Wonders of The Ancient World, where we were tasked to create 
buttons that changed the center image into different pictures, depending on which ancient wonder you want to view. I added additional 
functionalities to the website such as a "Visitor's guide" that includes a map and relevant details on the wonders, a "Learn more" page that 
hosts a web video, and a "Contact" page that allows visitors to get in touch.
