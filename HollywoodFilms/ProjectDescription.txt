On our main page, a grid of movies is displayed with each's description appearing upon hovering over the movie poster. A "Book Now" button appears as well, linking to a second web page where you can creatively select the movie, the location, time and date, and finally the seat. Once you click a "Book Ticket" button, your ticket appears.
